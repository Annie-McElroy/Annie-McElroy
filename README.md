# Hi, I'm Annie,

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer, Trainer, and Writer with a large love towards Daschunds. While I'm new to Web Development, I'm not new to the tech world (even if my experience was lack luster). After a stint at GIS, data analyising, training :heart: :fire: and managment :-1: :tired_face:, I quit and jumped into the world of Web Development by taking a coding bootcamp.

I'm enjoying the learning and can't wait to learn more!
